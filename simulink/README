This directory contains code for testing Simulink models using Haskell.
The Simulink code for the heater model is in Heater.slx, and for the
transmission is in brdemo_autotrans.mdl.

To use the code you will need:
  * The Glasgow Haskell compiler (GHC).
  * The GNU C compiler (GCC).
  * The Gnuplot plotting tool.
  * A copy of Matlab.

Start by locating the simulink/include subdirectory of your Matlab
installation, and copy the files rtw_continuous.h, rtw_solver.h and
solver_zc.h from there to here. Then run make.

You should now be able to type the following to run the heating
example with QuickCheck:

    make heater
    (in the prompt that appears:)
    main

When the property fails, you will get a plot in the file
failed_plot_.pdf.

You can also run the transmission example:

    make auto
    (in the prompt that appears:)
    import Test.QuickCheck
    (to test property 2' from the paper:)
    quickCheck prop_max_speed
    (to test property 3:)
    quickCheck prop_two_one_two
    (to test property 6:)
    quickCheck prop_speed
